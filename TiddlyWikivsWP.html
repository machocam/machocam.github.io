<h1>TiddlyWiki vs. WordPress</h1>

<body>
<p>For those of you who have been on the <a href=roamresearch.com>RoamResearch</a> train for a while might have already come across <a href=tiddlywiki.com>TiddlyWiki</a>. It took a little reading on twitter to run across it.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Give it a try.<br><br>Some of the earliest prototypes of Roam were just a Tiddlywiki with gifs of features that Tiddly didn&#39;t have so I could figure out how things should fit together.<br><br>We&#39;ve come a long way since then. Really love the hackability of TW though.</p>&mdash; Conor White-Sullivan (@Conaw) <a href="https://twitter.com/Conaw/status/1211976370047217664?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 31, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Iâ€™m not a big fan of locking my writing into someone elseâ€™s formats. I have been burnt by too many switches from one platform to another in the past. This is why this tweet by <a href=twitter.com/conaw>@conaw</a> peaked my interest. Whilst dabbling with the basics of <a href=tiddlywiki.com>TiddlyWiki</a> I noticed that it would make a for a great static site! This is where this whole idea came about. Thanks <a href=twitter.com/anthilemoon>@anthilemoon</a> for the inspiration!

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">One of the cool features of <a href="https://twitter.com/TiddlyWiki?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@TiddlyWiki</a> is its static website generator<br><br>These are fast, cheap to host, easy to maintain, well indexed by search engines... Perfect for a public digital garden! ðŸŒ±<a href="https://t.co/tNXsGHAKJy">https://t.co/tNXsGHAKJy</a></p>&mdash; Anne-Laure Le Cunff (@anthilemoon) <a href="https://twitter.com/anthilemoon/status/1252891361176625153?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 22, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>
Bottom line, my notes will be kept public on this site. Those notes will have most of the original content which you will find in the different posts I will be adding to the stream with time.
