# TLDR; 
- I used OSX and Windows and was recently forced back to LINUX
- I discovered bash scripting and don't know how I'm going to be able to go back now
- Linux is **ALL** about the terminal. If you can use that well, you will be able to have your computer anywhere where there is linux machine. 
- I'm a very happy campter in Linux. Still curious to see what Apple can do with ARM chips though! 

# I'm back to linux! 

Due to budget constraints I was a 100% linux user all throughout university. As soon as I had a enough cash I bought a macbook air about 5 years ago. I was a very happy camper in OSX. I really liked a few things: 
- It was stable
- Keyboard shortcuts are *extremely* consistent throughout apps 
- It's a UNIX system which meant that I could still use some of the CLI programs I grew accustomed to before

Then COVID hit and I noticed that I was not able to have a video call at the same time as screensharing since the computer would simply over-heat. I sold my beloved macbook air and took another big jump; I moved to Windows. Since my issue was lack of power with my macbook; I got an Asus G14 Zephyrus with 16gb RAM, Ryzen 9 etc. 

The machine was a beast, but the OS was garbage. Windows pushes updates down your throat and the chances it renders your machine unstable are about 50%. I couldn't believe that Microsoft had not been able to build a respetable OS after so many years of losing market share in the desktop space. 

I sold the G14 and just booted up a Thinkpad X250 that I had lying around. Night and day; it's insane to me that so many people are still using Windows when Linux is avaiable. It's orders of magniture better: 
- More stable, you update it when you want to update it. 
- Safer, for a basic user you can install everything from repositories. 
- Lighter which means that you can run more on less machine. 
- Super easy to script bespoke solutions to very particular problems using bash. 

Although I was originally thinking about buying the latest apple hardware witheir ARM chips; it feels like I'm going to stick to Linux for the foreseable future!
