<h1 id="syncthing-for-keeping-files-synced-accross-various-devices">Syncthing for keeping files synced accross various devices</h1>
<p>Syncing services like <a href="dropbox.com">Dropbox</a> or <a href="drive.google.com">Google Drive</a> add any limitations they like to the services they offer. Those limitations often have to do with drive size limits, the software they build for different platforms and finally not to mention hold you to their <em>Terms and Conditions</em>. </p>
<p>I was looking for a way to keep my <a href="https://keepass.info/">Keepass</a> database synced accross different devices. For now the best solution and one I have now tested for a only a few hours is <a href="https://syncthing.net/">syncthing</a>. The project is open source and can be followed on <a href="github.com">github</a> in <a href="https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing">this link</a>.</p>
<p>There are a few things about syncthing which are great: </p>
<ol>
<li>They have support for all platforms (it seems that ios is still missing but <a href="https://github.com/sgilani/Syncthing-iOS">it&#39;s being worked on</a>. </li>
<li>It&#39;s P2P which means that my keepass db doesn&#39;t have to sit on a server. </li>
<li>It&#39;s super light and easy to use. The <a href="https://github.com/calmh">people building it</a> have kept the interface a small piece of HTML which makes it super light and easy to update. </li>
<li>The project has been going on and stable for over 4 years. </li>
</ol>
