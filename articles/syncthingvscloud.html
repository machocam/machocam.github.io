<h1 id="syncthing-for-business">Syncthing for business</h1>
<p>I run a small online business and collaborate with 5 people who are in 3 different time-zones. Our business is just over 15 years old, over time we have gathered quite a few documents. About 3 years ago we started to use OneDrive to host these files so that we could share them. Then we switched to Google Drive so that we were able to collaborate using Gdoc and Gsheets. </p>
<p>Although both of these transitions created value they also split apart our data since we continued working on our local machines and not putting files into the cloud. Also, these plans started to get more and more expensive as we required more and more features. </p>
<p>That&#39;s why I&#39;m happy that I found <a href="syncthing.net">Syncthing</a> which has allowed us to have all of our files locally in everyone&#39;s machines kept in Sync. </p>
<h2 id="what-is-syncthing">What is Syncthing</h2>
<p>It&#39;s a cross platform program which allows you to select any folder and keep it in sync with other machines. Although it has many features such as receive only, send only, versioning and others that is its main function. </p>
<h2 id="why-has-it-been-great-for-us">Why has it been great for us</h2>
<p>It&#39;s dead simple to set up and maintain. It&#39;s a simple and small program which only does one thing well - this makes it easy to hack systems together. For example, this has allowed us to create a special directory with a <a href="https://keepassxc.org/">Keepass Database</a> which has allowed us to have shared passwords for the whole company for co-owned accounts. </p>
<p>Another nice benefit of Syncthing is that even if there is no internet, you can use your local network to share files across devices. Not to mention that it&#39;s completely independent of <em>any</em> cloud provider even yourself. That means, no security to deal with server side if you were planning on hosting yourself a <a href="https://nextcloud.com/">nextcloud instance</a> for example. </p>
<p>If even one or two of these seem like compelling arguments, I recommend you give it a try. Installation takes about 5 min and it&#39;s free! </p>
